**Author**: Douglas Mason (douglas.mason@mlb.com)
**Last Updated**: September 16, 2025 - Post-Karen Assessment

## Overview

Following Karen's comprehensive assessment, this document outlines the work remaining to reach 80% completion. While **critical functionality works** (authentication, vector store integration, real test generation), **major architectural components are missing** and require substantial implementation effort.

**Current State**: 45% Complete (Karen's validated assessment)
**Target**: 80% Complete for production readiness
**Gap**: 35% representing major missing components

## Karen's Assessment Validation

Karen's final review confirmed:
- ‚úÖ **Authentication handling ACTUALLY works** (5,190 character tests with full auth setup)
- ‚úÖ **Vector store integration properly connected** using ServerDrivenUIVectorStore
- ‚úÖ **All 6 validation tests passing**
- ‚ùå **Major architectural components are stubs** (CrewAI, Qdrant, advanced scenarios)
- ‚ùå **Completion claims were inflated** (45% actual vs 80-85% claimed)

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Working**

- **OpenAI Integration**: Real embeddings (1536 dimensions) with API calls
