# Implementation Progress - Current State

## Project Status: 45% Complete (Validated by Karen Agent)

### What's Actually Working
- **Core Pipeline**: IntelligentTestPipeline with authentication handling
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI embeddings + Mistral AI with graceful fallbacks
- **Vector Store**: Enhanced ServerDrivenUIVectorStore with business logic patterns
- **Test Generation**: Real WebDriver code (no Mock objects), component-specific IDs
- **Authentication**: Full auth setup for `requires_auth: true` components
- **End-to-End Validation**: 7/7 tests passing, component interactions verified

### Major Missing Components (35% Gap)
1. **CrewAI Multi-Agent System** (15% gap): Only stub implementations
   - TestGenerationCrew: 7-line stub class
   - UIValidatorAgent: raises ValueError
   - APIAnalyzerAgent: minimal implementation
   
2. **Qdrant Integration** (8% gap): In-memory only, Docker service not connected

3. **Advanced Test Scenarios** (7% gap): Missing performance/accessibility automation

4. **External Enrichment** (3% gap): Linkup integration stubbed

5. **MLB Advanced Features** (2% gap): Basic integration only

### Phase 2 Plan (45% â†’ 75% in 2-3 weeks)
- Week 1: CrewAI agent implementation
- Week 2: Qdrant integration + advanced scenarios
- Week 3: Production readiness

### Key Files Status
Working: intelligent_pipeline.py, vector_store.py, ai_test_generator.py, test_generator.py, pattern_extractor.py
Stubs: test_generation_crew.py, agents/ui_validator.py, external_enrichment.py

### Recent Achievements
- Fixed all 5 NotImplementedError exceptions
